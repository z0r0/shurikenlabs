So this is where it all begins. I've never been much for documentation, or even writing in general, and recently I've come to the realization that I should be doing more. I've come to realize that I've been graced with the knowledge and experiences of great mentors over the years, and that I should be giving back to the community. I've always struggled to find a way to pay it forward to those great mentors, and here I am. 

I've focused most of the past 10 years of my life working or studying information security on FOSS software and architectures, learning technical frameworks, and applying a security mindset to them. Specific focuses include:
- Writing exploits and preforming penetration tests.
- Maintaining perimeter defense and WAF rulesets.
- Building and scaling any sort of tooling required for internal security operations.

In the past few months however, I've been required to go down the technical journey of learning and applying security to the kubernetes and overall container orchestration. As I'm now coming up to breathe a little bit, I feel obligated to share everything I've learned and continue to learn. In all of my work, the one glaring thing I've noticed is that in an ecosystem where there's a plethora of knowledge and best practices as it pertains to container orchestration, there's unfortunately a shortage of security knowledge and best practices that actually come together to form cohesive security strategy. This site is intended to be a mash-up of the implementation of secure principals, with the paradigms and operational best practices of the kubernetes ecosystem.  

I intend to showcase all that I've learned through configuration and the orchestration of this very website that you're viewing over the next many posts. As always, my code can be viewed on my [Github](https://github.com/z0r0)

Thanks for reading!
